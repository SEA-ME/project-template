# Introduction

This training document is designed for students who will simulate the creation of a basic mobility ecosystem. The goal of the simulation is for students to understand the different components of a mobility ecosystem and how they interact with each other to create a seamless transportation experience for customers.

Renting a vehicle in an airport is still a traditional process for many companies: waiting in line, signing documents, checking the license, getting insurance, etc. This process is time consuming and ripe for digitalization.

Car sharing scenarios and business models are being extended to compete with traditional business models like airport rental. In order to disrupt the industry, they have to offer an improved airport experience. This requires the coordination of multiple participants in the mobility ecosystem through applications in the cloud.
This project will create such an example by integrating vehicle connectivity, autonomous driving and line of business applications for an enhanced user experience.

# Background Information

In today's world, transportation options are no longer limited to just one mode, such as driving or public transportation. Instead, multi-modal mobility is becoming increasingly popular as people seek more convenient and sustainable ways to travel.

Digital technologies have played a significant role in enabling multi-modal mobility and have revolutionized the way people plan and book their transportation options. By using digital platforms, customers can access real-time information about different modes of transportation, such as schedules, routes, and availability, all in one place.

Furthermore, digital platforms have made it possible for different companies to cooperate and integrate their services to provide a seamless multi-modal transportation experience to customers. For example, a customer may use a single app to book a ride-sharing service to a train station, take a train to their destination, and then use a bike-sharing service to reach their final destination.

However, this level of cooperation between different companies requires careful coordination and integration of digital technologies. Companies need to work together to ensure that their services are interoperable and can seamlessly connect with each other. This includes developing common standards for data sharing, payment systems, and customer information management.

This training document will explore the concept of cooperation between different companies using digital technologies for multi-modal mobility in more detail. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of this approach and provide examples of successful implementations. By the end of this document, you will have a better understanding of how digital technologies are enabling cooperation between different companies to provide a more convenient and sustainable multi-modal transportation experience to customers.

# Customer Scenario

We will create this project based on a near-future  scenario based on a customer **Persona**.

*Andrea is a business owner and frequent flyer member. Andrea travels at least once a month for work. Most of these trips are for a short duration.
Andrea is a member of a premium subscription-based car service with a fixed monthly  payment. As an add-on package, Andrea can also use courtesy vehicles in other cities.*

| Title	| Description	| Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
|Travel Preparations	| Andrea is planning a business trip and buys an airline ticket. The email confirmation is automatically added to the travel profile in her **trips app**.|  |
|Reserving a Car | At home, Andrea opens the Contoso Auto App. This app accesses the trip plan and presents a list of vehicle options available on the day at the destination airport. Andrea selects a different vehicle than her usual ride and confirms her selection.	| Reserving the car indicates which of the two vehicles will pick up Andrea when she reaches the curb |
| Landing in Frankfurt |	The flight is delayed by 60 minutes. She arrives in the middle of the night. She only has carry-on luggage, so she proceeds to the ground transportation service and to the designated area for vehicle pickups. The app knows her **location** and **estimated transit time**.	 | Requires simulation of beacons / position of the mobile app to indicate that she has arrived
| Come and pick me up | Meanwhile, her selected vehicle repositions itself automatically. It drives from a **closed staging area** to a **specially designated** location  | When the mobile app is considered “in position”, the selected vehicle will automatically move to the curb area.
| Getting in the Car |	As she reaches the curb on the pick-up area, her selected vehicle is already parked and ready. Andrea unlocks the car with her cell phone |	The transition from “autonomous” to “manual” driving is done using a RFC sensor. The user should be able to drive the car around manually
| It feels familiar  |	The vehicle **automatically downloads her user preferences** and adjusts the seat, temperature, her preferred streaming radio music station and pre-loads the navigation system to her hotel | The car should adjust automatically based on preferences set in the app
| Travelling back home | Andrea’s meetings are completed, she is returning home today! | User can drive the vehicle around manually
| Dropping the Car  | Andrea drives into the designated return area and leaves the vehicle. The vehicle drives automatically into the restricted parking area. Her app notifies her that the vehicle has been **returned successfully**.  | Driving the vehicle into the designated return area yields control of the car. The vehicle returns automatically and a confirmation is send to the app
| Vehicle Processing |As the vehicle enters the restricted parking area, a set of cameras performs a full scan of the vehicle exterior and interior.  | The system documents the state and any potential damage to the car. 	
| Ready for the next customer | The vehicle receives a notification to drive to an available cleaning reception slot. The vehicle state is documented including parameters such as current charge level, mileage and condition. The vehicle returns itself to the pool, ready to be used again. | Vehicle moves automatically to the “washing” designated area, and then moves back into “storage”

# Collaboration and Teamwork

Students will be working in teams of maximum six to complete this project. Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and responsibilities, and will be expected to contribute to the overall success of the project. Teams will be required to submit regular progress reports and to meet with the instructor for check-ins and feedback.  
</br>


# Mentorship and Support

Students will be provided with mentorship and support from the instructor throughout the project. The instructor will be available for questions and guidance, and will hold regular check-ins and progress reports to provide feedback and support.  
</br>


# Reflection and Self-Assessment

Students will be encouraged to reflect on their own learning and progress throughout the project. This will be done through self-assessment exercises and through feedback from the instructor and other team members.
